Demo Project for Ralph

```
Implement a script/process/service that can:

1. Monitor DNS TXT records of a specified $hostname every $d seconds.
2. Print date and time every time $substring is detected in any TXT record.
```

# Pre-requisites
- A *nix system. It "may" work with Windows, but this was not tested
- Python (tested with 3.11, but any fairly modern 3.x version should work) with `pip` and `virtualenv`
- A local file system location where you can read/write files locally
- Internet connection

# How to run

1. Clone repo

2. Create a python virtual environment and activate it
```shell
> python -m venv venv

> source env/bin/activate
```
3. Install additional required libraries in the virtual environment
```shell
> pip install -r requirements
```
4. Run the application
```shell
> python main.py
```

# Important Files
`config.yml` - YAML file containing entries for: url, substring to search for and time interval to query

`requirements.txt` - List of additional Python dependencies

`errors.log` - Logfile containing errors. Autogenerated
